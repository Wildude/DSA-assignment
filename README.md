The male represesentative was contacted regarding the due date for which he said was 3 days later:

Submission date: Monday, Jan 27, 2025
Since this repo was extended from a previous (and at the time ongoing) implementation "link here", <br>
it was found a little too "complicated" by the group members which to be fair it was. <br>
after all, it's an assignment and not a project and though the extended use of an already implemented structure <br>
saves time, but so does GPT.
another reason was there was no power by the time, 2 whole days and there was no progress made, which can be seen from the commit history. <br>
Another (3rd) reason, is lack of clarificaiton and misunderstanding, <br>
Aparently the operations of linked list must be done with the BST as well.
Since time was relative, I was forced to give up and let GPT's code be submitted.
- However, I am still working on it cause one has to finish what he started.
